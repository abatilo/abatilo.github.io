title: Should I join FullContact?
---

Please, this is not to be shared publicly. If I've sent it to you, it's because I deeply value your opinion and would appreciate your thoughts on how I should proceed. You can skip up to where it says "That's enough background." if you want to, well, skip the background.

As I write this, I'm currently at a cross roads in my career. Emotions are high and my thoughts are all over the place. I have a new career opportunity and I need to figure out what matters to me. What's going to propel my growth? What or who is the developer that I want to become. What do I want to learn, where do I want to grow? My brain tends to be very scattered with thoughts, so I'm going to try and write everything out like a long form pros/cons list. I want to lay out how I've grown in detail, problems I've solved, problems I would need to solve, and analyze how I want to grow and what is important to me, etc.

I currently work at a startup in Denver, CO where we are building a voice control platform for IoT devices. From a conceptual perspective, we're similar to Amazon Alexa or Google Home, but we cater to a set of IP-enabled devices that are found in large, luxury homes. The devices that Alexa or Google Home control tend to be more general consumer facing.

In 2015, prior to joining Josh.ai, I was working as a System Administrator at Northrop Grumman. I had benefits, I had a retirement plan, I had paid time off, etc. I was frustrated with how my raise was evaluated that year, and so I became very curious and looked around online. I decided that with how massive of a company Northrop Grumman is, it wasn't surprising that my raise was handled the way it was. I stumbled upon a website named AngelList where you could look for jobs at startups. I thought that maybe a startup would be nicer because then I'm surrounded by smart, motivated people. I wouldn't get caught up in the corporate red tape. AngelList works on a mechanic similar to Tinder. You mark companies that you like, and companies do the same for candidates. If you both liked each other, you would get connected. I ended up filtering for companies in Denver, and I hit like on every single company, regardless of position, regardless of salary, etc.

About 36 hours later or so, I received an email from our CEO and co-founder Alex. He was asking me if we could chat on the phone for what was supposed to be an open source AI platform for controlling your home. I replied and said I'd love to. It sounded perfect. I was really into artificial intelligence and machine learning at the time. In early 2015 is when I had convinced myself that the dream job would be to work at Google on the self-driving car project. Working on an AI at a startup would be awesome. We had the phone call, then later that evening Alex asked me if I could drive up to Denver (I was in Colorado Springs) to interview with him, the other co-founder and CTO Tim, and one of the first engineers, Michael. Alex was actually stationed in LA, and he was flying back soon. I agreed to drive up the next day to interview. The following morning, I looked up the three people in this company and discovered that Alex had had several companies before, Tim has a net worth in the 9 figures from a previous venture, and Michael had just left Redmond, Seattle, where he was working for Microsoft. These guys were all really impressive and it made me nervous. The night before they sent me a beta for the product and asked me to play with it a little. I did, and that day for the interview, they asked me to do some work in the beta environment. The interview went really well. We talked about a lot of cool ideas, and we got lunch at a nearby taco place and talked even more. Less than 24 hours from that point, Alex emailed me to let me know they wanted to make me an offer for a software engineering internship. I was really confused because I wasn't currently an intern, but the pay was going to be significantly higher than what I was currently making. Plus I was only going to have to work part time. My room mates and I went out to dinner to celebrate. We had hibachi. I had steak and scallops, it was great. Alex called while we were eating and asked me if I had a chance to look at the offer. I told him that I was at dinner, celebrating the fact that I was going to accept.

That's enough background.

What do I want?
I want to become the best programmer that I can become.

What does it mean to be a good programmer? Why aren't you one now?
A good programmer is someone who can methodically break down problems that can be solved with computer software, and write the software that solves those problems. A good programmer is someone that can look at the big picture but zoom in when needed. They have an understanding of solving a problem that serves a purpose. The best programmers that I know always have some form of specialty. John Carmack has basically spent his entire life working on graphics. Very high performance simulations, etc. Jonathan Blow has spent almost his entire life working on video games. They all get intimately familiar with a specific domain and spend their life drilling down into that field. I'm not sure at this point if you have to specialize to be a good programmer. But I think you need to specialize to become one of the best programmers. There's too much to know, too much to learn, for you to become the best at all of them. No matter how hard you try. I would actually consider myself a good programmer, but I'm not a good enough programmer.

What are you missing to become a good enough programmer?
I want to be the best. I need to grow and I want to find my field to grow into. 

What fields have you considered?
For a long time I thought that would be in security, but I was wrong. Computer security has offensive and defensive parts to it. The defensive parts are boring, and the offensive parts are controversial. Both are really difficult. I think if I had to choose, I would pick to be an offensive cyber security specialist. The problem with that, is that being a penetration tester doesn't give me the same amount of development that I'd like. As a pen tester, you'd largely be using tools that are vetted. You might write your own but that's certainly more rare. Writing malware isn't really much of a career either, unless it was state sponsored. However, I don't think I'd like to have a career in that environment/field. That leaves you to defensive security. Maybe I could work at an anti-virus company, or be a malware researcher. I definitely don't want tot be a malware researcher. There's forms of research that I would like, but not this one. It all becomes too political for my tastes. Same with anti-virus companies. Viruses are strange to deal with and analyze. It's interesting work, and I want to learn more, but I don't want it as my day to day job.

Then for a while I thought that would be in game development. Games are a wonerful creative outlet that lots of people get to enjoy. When you work on a game, you're likely using an engine to do the development, and writing code using a scripting language like Lua. I've enjoyed my fair share of video game playing, but gameplay development doesn't feel like what I want to do either. I've made an Android game and thinking about balance, or thinking about achievement, these are fun, so that's a plus. But the gameplay development and testing quickly became boring. I would have much rather been a person working on developing the engine. The tool that makes the games run at 60fps, the tool that everyone uses to make the games. Your code has to be fast, it has to be robust, etc. The problem I found with this is that I'm really lacking in the skills for this type of development. You need to be good with graphics. You need to know about hardware. And actually, I'd be intersted in teaching myself these things, but ultimately, game development studios and the industry in general are known for hard crunch times and poor pay. I understand that it works out for the people who are truly passionate about it. I can't say that I'm so driven to work in the games industry to make those compromises. Games, again, seem like something I'd really do for fun.

Then I thought maybe I could specialize in mobile development. Mobile development is fun. You're working in a limited resource environment which provides for a fun challenge. Mobile apps and platforms have changed the way the world works. It's incredible. The problem I have with mobile development is that the ideas for apps largely seem very trivial. Of course there are a few companies where this is not the case. Many times, mobile apps are just mobile versions of a web interface. Sometimes they're a game. The problems that an app developer might face aren't really ones that entice me. As an app developer, I've had to figure out why my UI looked different on a phone with a different resolution. Sometimes I've had to figure out why the garbage collector wasn't getting rid of certain references, but that's not specific to app development. Mobile development is cool though in that almost anyone can go and download your app to try it. Ultimately though, the problems you face with that aren't what I'd want to spend my time doing.

What else have you done?
I've had to do full stack development, and some embedded like C++ development. Getting really good at C++ development is nice for doing the graphics in game engine development. My mind likes having to understand the intricacies of writing C++ code where you have to do a lot of things for yourself. Not a lot is taken care of for you. I use vim as my development environment too because I don't always like an IDE to do everything for me.
