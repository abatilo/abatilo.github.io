title: How to get better at reading code
---

- Do you understand the code base?
- If there are tests, go look at them. They should have examples of input, and then examples of expected output
- If there aren't tests, writing them is a great way to learn about expectations
- Learn to develop a mental model
- Guessing means you don't understand it
- Understand everything in small chunks at a time. TAKE TIME TO LET IT SIT. This is anecdotal, but cramming too much doesn't really give you any real understanding
