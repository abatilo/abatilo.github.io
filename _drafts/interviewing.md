title: Interviewing as a Software Engineer
---
Interviewing as a software engineer is effectively broken. As an interviewer, it's basically impossible to really determine someone's skill level, and as an interviewee it's basically impossible to prove to someone why they should hire you.

Let's look at the structure of interviewing, and then talk about what interviewing would be like in a perfect world.

When you're an interviewer, there is one question that you need to answer. That question is, "Is this person capable of providing value to this company?". Businesses need to generate revenue. Ideally they even generate profit. Employees are vehicles to generating revenue, and regardless of how ideal or positive you might be, that's exactly what you're there for. As the person making a hiring decision, or just providing feedback to someone who will make a hiring decision, you have to determine whether or not this person will help in that goal. The company will typically be paying some salary (or equivalent) to this person, which means at the very minimum, that person needs to provide enough value to match their salary.

Say someone gets paid $100,000 a year. This potential hire at the absolute bare minimum, must generate $100,000 a year in revenue or value for the company, otherwise that hire is a money pit. It's worth pointing out, that this breaks for a company like Google. Almost all of their money comes from search ads, but not every single engineer is working on search. When a company prints money like they do, the rules just break in general. Anyways, back on topic.

In what ways can someone provide value? Well, maybe you work on a feature that gets the company more customers. Maybe you wrote a clone of some service that's paid for, and you reduce costs elsewhere. Maybe you come in and refactor something which helps other people implement a feature that provides value, which means you've also, albeit indirectly, but you've also provided value. The ways that someone can provide value is endless. This is a problem. This is a real problem because that means that with no limitation of parameters, everyone can decide differently how to determine if someone will provide value. There's a bias in how everyone is going to think about providing value. This also means that everyone is going to have a different way to evaluate what kind of value you would provide. This is entirely broken.

Interviewing is too emotional. If you interview with someone on a bad day, they're going to fixate on reasons why you couldn't possibly provide value. If you interview with someone whom with you have a lot in common, then they're going to inherently believe that you could provide value, because they think they provide value. Of course they probably provide value, but they're attributing the wrong characteristics to why you could provide value. It doesn't matter if you both like the same TV shows, or you guys come from the same small town. Those factors will not help you provide value, but they will make the interviewer like you more, and they'll make them want to find reasons to hire you.

Interviewing is too blind. Writing software is so much more than just the act of writing code. If you want to write software professionally, you're talking about planning, debugging, writing, testing, bug reporting, all sorts of things. But most people will only interview on two things: culture fit, and technical ability.  

- Resume screenings
- Answering personality questions
