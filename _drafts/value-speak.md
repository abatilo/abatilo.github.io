I frequently like to lurk around the
  [/r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/) subreddit
  and see what kinds of questions and answers float around there. As a general
  statement, I really disagree with the mentality that most people have in that
  community. The goal of too many people is to land a job at some BigN/FAANG
  company. They grind and grind LeetCode and think that that's the mark of
  success. Obviously, not everyone feels like that, but there's an overwhelming
  sentiment that if you're not working for a FAANG that you're somehow some
  kind of failure in this field.

Anyways, one of the recurring questions that I see a lot and feel comfortable
talking about are salary negotiations. Especially when it comes time for a
annual raises. It all started when I read [Fearless Salary
Negotiation](https://fearlesssalarynegotiation.com/)<sup>1</sup> and the [Kalzumeus blog
post about salary
negotiation](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/) a few
years ago. I started from a very timid and scared position when it comes to
salary negotiations. The imposter syndrome and what not made it easy to think
that you were being entitled or just expecting too much and being unreasonable.

Over a span of about 3.5 years, I've approximately quadrupled my total
compensation. It's easier to get those large multiples when you start out from
a very low salary, but that's still a 4x increase. I'm making 4x more money per
year than I was making in June of 2016. Another property to add here is that
for each of these job offers and raises, I did NOT have a competing job offer
that I used to make employers bid, nor have I attained any of these high
compensations by working at a FAANG. I've never even received a job offer from
any FAANG.

So, how do I do it? It turns out that it's actually not as scary as you might
think. You just need to learn to speak the language that the company wants to
hear. When you're focused on delivering business value and you become adept at
driving conversations from that lense, people start to listen to you. I've
personally found that even if you don't know how to answer the questions, but
you're merely a moderator for other conversations, people will start to view
you as an expert. It's not that surprising when you think about it. You're just
focusing on how to communicate in such a way that makes it clear that your
intentions revolve entirely around delivering value to the business and to the
customers. It should also come as no surprise that when you become really
comfortable with executing on these conversations, that you'll see a side
effect of interviews becoming easier.

In this post, I want to go over a few of my favorite phrases to use, when I use
them, and why I believe they've been so successful. But I want to start with a
couple of counter examples and misconceptions.

The fallacy of: "If you build it, he will come". This quote from the movie
"Field of Dreams" is a great summary of the mind set of many people I've met in
the industry and people on the internet.

> If I'm really strong in a techical capacity, it'll be really obvious and everyone will love it and I'll be rewarded greatly

Nope. That's not how it works. You can become a **good** software engineer just
from your technical abilities. But if you only ever focus on your technical
abilities, you're more just honing the computer scientist skill set. The
problem here is that you're not just a computer scientist. You're a software
engineer that's employed by some company. And in the majority of cases,
management is not going to care at all about the differences between using
language X or Y, or why you used tool X or Y, or whether or not you used design
pattern X or Y. You're not there to be solely a computer scientist. The point
of employment is that a company will pay you a certain amount of money with the
implicit agreement that you will deliver value equal or greater to what they
pay you. I say this a lot because it's very true. That's the **entire** basis
of employment. If you're costing the company more money than you save them, or
help them make back, then you're a net negative resource and you shouldn't be
employed there anymore. You need to become a software engineer that's valuable
to the business. More details on how to do that might be a future blog post. I
just wanted to set the stage for how you can communicate starting right now, to
help lay the framework for you being business driven.

### *The phrases*

#### What is the **actual** problem we're trying to solve?
Whenever you're hit with any kind of request, this is absolutely the first
question that you need to get answered, because it's almost never clear. It's
all about gathering context. You can't be helpful unless you have the context
of what's going on. Let's use a real life example. I've been helping another
team at my company switch their manually managed Kubernetes infrastructure to
using a set of automated tooling that I developed with a colleague.

I've been asked the following question recently:
> Do you know why my secrets are coming back empty?<sup>2</sup>

This is the first question in the conversation that I received. I want to point
out, this isn't a bad question in itself. But if I'm to help you, I just need
to understand all of what is going on here. Why are they asking about secrets?
Do they understand the implications of it? Do they understand how to do it? Do
they even need to set any at all in the first place?

#### Is this a treatment or a cure?
#### What are my/your metrics of success?
#### Can you help me understand?
#### We've gotten lost in this conversation.
#### I can't answer you with any confidence right now.

<sup>1</sup> I'm even a testimonial on the website, and I inform the author of salary changes that lag 1 position behind my current job

<sup>2</sup> Secrets refer to [Kubernetes secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/). Basically, values that you don't want to be easily read by other people. Like a password
