title: Things to remember during a code review
---

- Code reviews take time
- The point of them is to help find bugs, and to make sure that code is understandable by outside parties
- Don't let the little things get to you, stylistic preference doesn't matter
- Keep the code reviews small, the less lines there are, the easier it is to follow
- Code reviews don't have to only be for master branches
- Be aggressive when you don't understand something. If someone asks for clarification, give it to them with no questions. Just because it makes sense to you, doesn't mean it does for them.
- Code reviews need the right culture supporting it. Be terse but fair, don't take things personally, and remember the goal from all parties is to improve the code base
