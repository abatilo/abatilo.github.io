title: A primer to collections in Java
---

The Java standard library is large and covers a lot of the most common cases in computer science. The collections that are part of the standard library are tried and true, tested to be able to handle at a production scale. In this post I want to go over some of the common collections and to breakdown their characteristics, all so that I can get a really firm understanding of the available collections in the Java standard library.

# ArrayList
# LinkedList
# List
# HashSet
# LinkedHashSet
# TreeSet
# PriorityQueue
# Map
# HashMap
# LinkedHashMap
# TreeMap
# Hashtable

Not in Collections
# Comparable vs Comparator
# Vector
# java.util.concurrent
