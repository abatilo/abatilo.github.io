title: Useful topics that schools don't teach
---
Computer Science, and the IT industry in general are gaining a lot more visibility and insight these days. It's becoming less "nerdy" to become a programmer. In fact, [there's a lot of movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA) towards making programming a very cool thing to do. I'm only 23 as I write this, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel a little hipster-y about it. I'm sure the generations before me would all say the same towards my generation. Kids are being exposed to programming concepts at increasingly younger ages. People say that it teaches very useful problem solving skills, even if you don't go on to become a professional programmer. There's a lot of discussion about whether or not you really need to go to college to become a programmer. According to [this](http://www.businessinsider.com/google-hiring-non-graduates-2013-6) Business Insider article, Laszlo Bock is quoted as saying: "...So we have teams where you have 14 percent of the team made up of people who've never gone to college."

It's true. Programming can be largely self-taught. Personally, if you feel like you can really be a studious learner, I don't think you need to get a degree in Computer Science, or a college degree at all. Some companies are going to view having one as necessary, but in my experience, the number of companies that require one is going down at a sharp pace. The industry is becoming more and more open to taking demonstrable experience as a substitute.

With that being said, say you decide to go for an undergraduate degree in Computer Science, or a related programming degree, there's a few things that I've noticed to be missing from people out of college that I want to outline.

# Debugging
Debugging as a skill is something that a lot of programs seem to just ignore. Many programs will just say that the debugging you pickup while you're working on your assignments is plenty. I think this is well-intentioned but not true. Learning to debug, especially in code that you didn't write, is very difficult. When you're in school, many of your assignments will be solo assignments, and the projects are small enough that you'll be able to understand the entirety of the codebase which makes it a lot easier to debug. I can't recall the number of times I was working on an assignment and when I saw a bug in the output, I knew exactly which code to fix without having to step through anything.
