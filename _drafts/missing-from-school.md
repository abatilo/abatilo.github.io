title: Useful topics that schools don't teach
---
Computer Science, and the IT industry in general are gaining a lot more visibility and insight these days. It's becoming less "nerdy" to become a programmer. In fact, [there's a lot of movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA) towards making programming a very cool thing to do. I'm only 23 as I write this, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel a little hipster-y about it. I'm sure the generations before me would all say the same towards my generation. Kids are being exposed to programming concepts at increasingly younger ages. People say that it teaches very useful problem solving skills, even if you don't go on to become a professional programmer. There's a lot of discussion about whether or not you really need to go to college to become a programmer. According to [this](http://www.businessinsider.com/google-hiring-non-graduates-2013-6) Business Insider article, Laszlo Bock is quoted as saying: "...So we have teams where you have 14 percent of the team made up of people who've never gone to college."

It's true. Programming can be largely self-taught. Personally, if you feel like you can really be a studious learner, I don't think you need to get a degree in Computer Science, or a college degree at all. Some companies are going to view having one as necessary, but in my experience, the number of companies that require one is going down at a sharp pace. The industry is becoming more and more open to taking demonstrable experience as a substitute.

With that being said, say you decide to go for an undergraduate degree in Computer Science, or a related programming degree, there's a few things that I've noticed to be missing from people out of college that I want to outline.

# Debugging
Debugging as a skill is something that a lot of programs seem to just ignore. Many programs will just say that the debugging you pickup while you're working on your assignments is plenty. I think this is well-intentioned but not true. Learning to debug, especially in code that you didn't write, is very difficult. When you're in school, many of your assignments will be solo assignments, and the projects are small enough that you'll be able to understand the entirety of the codebase which makes it a lot easier to debug. I can't recall the number of times I was working on an assignment and when I saw a bug in the output, I knew exactly which code to fix without having to step through anything.

Debugging is the process of determine which part of your code is causing an unintended flaw. Print debugging is the most common form of debugging. You just run your program and print values out and see if they match your expectations as you progress through the program. This kind of debugging can be kind of useful because it's almost teaching you to write logging for your program. Of course, this isn't entirely true, because a print debugging is usually done with very small amounts of context or formatting. It's usually only temporary until you can figure out the problem. If you have a nice debugger tool, learning to setup breakpoints and watching variable values, is usually very helpful. If you work in an IDE, these tools are pretty much standard. I definitely recommend that you get comfortable with some UI based debugger in whichever IDE you're using.

Perhaps more important, are steps that you can take for trying to find the offending code. Being able to dissect a code base is a great measure for how well you know it. Fixing a bug can be a great way to become familiar with how all of the pieces fall together.

If you're a new developer, be it from a university or from a bootcamp, you should absolutely read _How To Be A Programmer_ which you can buy online or read for free here: [How To Be a Programmer](https://github.com/braydie/HowToBeAProgrammer).

This book goes far deeper into the topics that you should absolutely know, and it's one of the most important books that I think every developer should read
