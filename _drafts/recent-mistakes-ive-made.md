title: Recent mistakes I've made
---
Making mistakes is okay and expected, but what matters most is that you take the mistakes and leverage them as a catalyst to your own improvement. In this post are a few mistakes that I've made over the last few weeks, both small an large, and what I've learned because of them.

1. Having a "visible" flag.

2. Forgetting about when things are deleted and need to be recreated
