  <h1>Aaron Batilo's Projects</h1>
  <p>This site is dedicated to posts about projects I have hosted on GitHub that I am proud of and feel like they deserve to be talked about</p>

  <p>This site also serves as a side project for when I want to learn more about web development</p>

  <p>To see my actual blog where I talk about things other than my projects, click <a href="http://www.thoughtbacon.com">here</a></p>
