        <p>My name is Aaron. I’m currently an Android Developer for a startup in Colorado, but in the past I’ve had jobs with multiple different full tech stacks, I’ve worked as a system administrator, and I’ve contracted small projects before. I’ve also worked on data visualization projects, social network analysis, and malware analysis. I did undergraduate research in natural language processing and I think machine learning is really cool.</p>

<p>I like to learn and consider myself at least average at it. I also like to write and consider myself at least average at it.</p>
