I just want to get this out of the way. I don't want to do a long review of 2019.
More has happened in 2019 than I could ever possibly recap accurately.
But a couple of highlights:
- I launched a product
- I love AWS
- I love Kubernetes
- I've made some that I hope to be life long friends
- I'm good at saving money for companies
- Escape rooms are the greatest
- I bought my first house

I got basically none of my goals for 2019 accomplished, but I still had what
  I'd deem to be a successful year. I set too many goals for 2019 and they were
  all too specific. So this time my goals are:
- Exercise
- Do cool things
- Appreciate those around me that make my life better


I've been thinking a lot lately about the differences between my last job and
my current job. I left my last job about 6 months ago. My day to day isn't that
different. I can't expect it to be that different. I write code, I build
infrastructure, I automate things.

[I used to think that you should work at a startup when you got out of
college](https://medium.com/@joshdotai/startup-vs-big-company-a-college-perspective-16eff02bdbf9),
or for your first job. Now that I've been around for a couple of years, my
opinion's changed. Actually, maybe it's not that my opinion has changed, but
more so that I think we were focusing on the wrong question. I was worried
about the idea of a big company with a bunch of red tape over the flexibility
and agility of a brand new startup.

When I joined Josh.ai, the company was less than 10 people. The product was
still very new, and there were no customers. I think this is a problem.

At my last job, I spent about a year and a half developing a brand new product
which was named and released as [Conga AI
Analyze](https://conga.com/workflow-automation-software/business-process-automation-insights/ai-contracts).
At my current company, we have a small number of very important customers.
While I was at Conga, I lost sight of a very important part of being a software
engineer. I forgot what it took to run something in production with customers.
The observability that's required to debug in production. The process you need
to handle incidents.

I went to the opposite extreme by having such huge customers, but it reminds me
  about what it takes to be truly customer focused. To be value delivery
  driven. How do you communicate with a customer to let them know about the
  changes you need to make? How do you check all the boxes to make sure things
  go well? How do you know what's happening in production?

There's an argument that it's better to be at a small startup so that you can
be around to organically learn how to work with customers. It's a nice thought
in theory, but in practice it breaks down. Just like the idea of being at a
smaller company means that you can get better mentorship since there isn't as
much red tape. These don't really hold up in practice because when you're in a
startup, you just don't have the time or bandwidth to do any of that anymore.
As much as you tell yourself that that isn't true, as a startup you have to be
more focused on delivering customer value than anything. You don't have time
for engineering practice. You don't have time to be mentored. You might say
that this is just a sign of the company that I was at. You're probably right,
but I'd wager that any company that small isn't really focused on grooming or
mentoring.

All that being said, choosing a job is hard. There are a lot of factors to
consider. Commute, pay, alignment with your goals, financial stability of the
company. But what I've learned from my current job is that having a culture
where customers are important, that should be a big part of the equation. The
catch is, you need to find a culture where customers aren't important enough to
derail your every move. Someone at my current company said something along the
lines of: "Last year we were customer obsessed and that made it hard to be
focused on our own goals. This year we want to be customer focused. The
difference is that we need to prioritize what we need to do to help every
customer at a global scale, not just try to keep each customer happy
individually in a silo.". I like this sentiment a lot. How do you find that
balance? How do you ask questions in your interview that indicates a healthy
balance? I'm not entirely sure to be honest, but if I ever figure it out, maybe
I'll write a blog post about that too.
