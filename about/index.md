My name is Aaron. I'm a software engineer based in Denver, CO. I have a wide range of interests, spanning video game exploitation, machine learning, internet of things, and Android development.

I've had jobs with multiple different full tech stacks, I've worked as a system administrator, and I've contracted small projects before. I've also worked on data visualization projects, social network analysis, and malware analysis. I did undergraduate research in natural language processing and I think machine learning is really cool.

I started by automating video games in 2008. This got me started in cyber security. At 16 I started the first of several summer internships at Northrop Grumman that went from 2011 to 2015.

In 2012, I started attending the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs for their Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program. When not doing summer internships, I had several jobs on campus as a student web developer, student research assistant, and teaching assistant/assistant lecturer.

In 2015, I grew an interest in machine learning and moved out of the cyber security space. During the summer of 2015 I joined a newly founded startup in home automation as an intern to help them create their cloud infrastructure. In the summer of 2016 I joined full time to work on the Android app used to communicate with our smart home product.
