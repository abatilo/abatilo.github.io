# Who am I?
My name is Aaron Batilo. I'm fascinated by the obscure and I invest time in what
interests me. I've been a [competitive
yo-yoer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy6fglH3Uww). I've been internationally ranked
in the top 2% of StarCraft 2 players (serving for the queen of blades). I was a [budding
competitive pool
player](https://www.napaleagues.com/stats.php?playerSelected=Y&playerID=10020200).

I got into computer science-y stuff first when I got really into
[MapleStory](http://maplestory.nexon.net/). Someone released an [alternative
backend](https://mapleref.fandom.com/wiki/OdinMS) for the game, known as a private
server. I took the code and followed tutorials to run my own copy. I got really into it
and started learning about code to figure out how all the pieces worked together. I went
back to playing the main game but focused on hacking and automating the game. In high
school [I interned with Northrop Grumman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37-P7VbJb34)
for a few back to back years. I got a clearance and kept interning into college doing
some Linux system administration work. I got really into AI and left Northrop Grumman to
intern with
[Josh.ai](https://medium.com/@joshdotai/i-made-a-computer-pretend-to-be-a-computer-that-s-pretending-to-be-a-human-here-s-what-happened-128173751967).
I dropped out of college and worked at Josh.ai full time doing our Android app, worked
on our NLP, worked on the backend, and worked on device integrations (it was a really
small company at the time). I left Josh.ai and worked for FullContact where I caught the
operations bug. I helped migrate existing services to run on Kubernetes and [I helped
build ML
capabilities](https://www.fullcontact.com/blog/experimentation-leads-innovation-machine-learning-fullcontact/)
into one of our services. I left FullContact to join Conga where I joined a greenfield
team to build a new ML based contract analyzer. We built it on Kubernetes and I focused
on CI/CD and automating data ingest and model building. When our lead left, I got
promoted to run the team and we [launched that
product](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190423005393/en/Conga%C2%AE-Unveils-New-Artificial-Intelligence-Engine).
After product launch, I helped other teams become cloud native. I left Conga to join
[iStreamPlanet](https://istreamplanet.com/).

I've made my career out of teaching people how to efficiently use Amazon Web
Services and Kubernetes. I believe in optimizing what I like to call the
developer experience. It's one thing for me to be a capable developer or
operations engineer, but it's much more impactful if I can improve the
productivity of everyone in my engineering organization.

This comes through building sophisticated CI/CD pipelines that let you develop
fearlessly, building cross platform and repeatable local development
environments, and much more.

**I am operations focused.** While my primary objective may be to write code for solving
product problems, I've learned over the years that you could write perfect code, but
without a solid infrastructure behind it, you'll never be able to scale out your system.

I run my own [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) cluster in AWS,
built through [kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops). That's exactly how I run this
blog.

**I am competitive.** I like to be the best. I want to be better than I am. But
something that I want to explicitly point out is that I'm not interested in becoming the
best by bringing others down. I thoroughly believe that by leveraging and collaborating
with those around me, that it's the most efficient way to improve.

**I am a life long learner.** I'm always looking to figure out how to improve. I always
operate with the goal to have my organic reputation to being the person who "works the
hardest towards self improvement". Notice, I don't want to be the best or fastest. I
don't want to work the most hours or even improve the most. I just want people to know,
recognize, and acknowledge that I put in the most effort and attention into becoming
better.

**I am focused on human scalability.** I keep human scalable solutions in the front of
my mind. This can mean linters, static analaysis, or other tooling. I will help
consolidate the local development stories on the teams that I work with, and I will help
the team understand why this is a productivity booster both for individuals and for the
organization.

**I am an automation addict.** If I ever have to do something repeatedly, I will spend time to
automate it away. If it has to be done off work hours, so be it. Automating my own tasks
and expectations will free me up to do other interesting work. In my opinion, it's the
only way to scale as a human being. If something is inconveniencing me, I will automate
it.

**I am not a hero.** I don't believe in heroics. Working crazy hours or being known as
the person to always respond first to an on-call pager? I fully disagree with all of
these scenarios. Software development should be sustainable. Rushing hours or being in
fear of getting paged won't lend itself to my happiness.

**I am data driven.** I use both [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/) and
[RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/) to help me understand where my time is going.
I believe in the [quantified self](https://quantifiedself.com/) movement and strive to
quantify everything I do. I have sleep trackers, fitness trackers, etc.

**I am egoless.** My concern is never that I am right. I have no problems admitting I am
wrong, and in fact I do it openly and freely. My concern is that we're making the right
decisions **as a team**. If I'm passionate about a topic, you'll know it, but I'm only
trying to make sure that we're considering everything that we can.

**I am transparent.** There are no secrets with me. I don't want to spend my time dealing
with that. I want to spend my time being engaged and thinking ahead. I am what you see,
and you'll always know exactly how I feel.

**I am simple.** I use [vim](https://www.vim.org/) and
[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) for all of my development. I write code exclusively
on a command line. I don't like IDEs. I think they hide away too much. I try my best to
list out my tools on my [vimrc](https://github.com/abatilo/vimrc) repository. This
repository has admittedly expanded to housing my dotfiles as well.

If you've actually read my profile, and you think I might be a fit for your
company, you can [look at my resume](https://www.aaronbatilo.dev/resume) and
[send me an email](mailto:aaronbatilo+blog@gmail.com). If you email me there,
I'll commit to responding to you quickly.
