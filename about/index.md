I started programming when at 14 because I hated grinding in video games. I made the computer do it. I have worked on mobile, web, server, and desktop programs. I have ample experience in DevOps. I prefer programs to be simple, performant, and reliable. I enjoy artificial intelligence, home automation, and reading about programming.

Thanks.
