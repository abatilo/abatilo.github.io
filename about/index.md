I started programming in 2008 to create programs to help people manage their MapleStory private servers. I got interested in cyber security and helped create Bizarro Trainer for (what was) w8baby.com. In 2011, I worked at Northrop Grumman for a few years, and also worked for the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs. In 2015, I joined a startup in Denver, CO named [Josh.ai](https://www.josh.ai) where we're bringing you a natural voice interface for controlling your smart home devices. I've done everthing from crawling under the floor to wire server racks all the way up the stack to writing CSS. I believe software should be robust, reliable, and performant. These days I enjoy machine learning, home automation, cloud infrastructure and scaling, and native Android development.
