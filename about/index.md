My name is Aaron. I read a lot about programming and I think a lot about programming. Every now and then I feel like writing about programming. If what I'm writing is short, you'll probably find it on my [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/thoughtbacon). If the writing needs more space, you'll find it here instead.

Also, feel free to email me at: [aaron@baatilo.io](mailto:aaron@baatilo.io) if you feel like chatting.
