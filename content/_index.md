### Things I've built

---

These are all projects that I've built for myself and not for the company I was
working for. For work history and experience, check out my [/resume](/resume)
or my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abatilo).

- [https://coloradoexcluded.com](https://coloradoexcluded.com), A website that
  lists companies that are avoiding hiring in the state of Colorado. Possibly
  because of the [Equal Pay For Equal Work
  Act](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb19-085) or for other reasons.
- [pulumi-composite-actions](https://github.com/abatilo/pulumi-composite-actions),
  an alternative to the official Pulumi GitHub Actions that supports commenting
  on a pull request only when there's detected changes as well as Pulumi's
  internal S3 state locking with built in retries.
- [EC2Throughput](https://ec2throughput.info), learn what it means for an EC2
  instance to have ”Up to N Gigabit” network performance. All benchmarks are
  ran automatically and published to the website immediately after tests
  complete.
- [github-action-locks](https://github.com/abatilo/github-action-locks),
  DynamoDB based locking for use in a GitHub Actions workflow to guarantee
  atomic execution of your GitHub Actions.

  a demo project where I demonstrate an implementation of [Heroku's Review
  Apps](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration-review-apps)
  and [FeaturePeek](https://featurepeek.com/) for container based web services.
- [Actions Panel](https://actionspanel.app), former GitHub App for managing
  manual execution of GitHub Actions. GitHub themselves, Microsoft, Docker,
  Tidal Music, MGM Resorts and over 200 other users had the GitHub App
  installed before GitHub released the feature themselves 6 months after
  launch.
- [actions-poetry](https://github.com/abatilo/actions-poetry), a GitHub Action
  for executing [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) the Python
  package management tool. It's been kept up to date with GitHub Action best
  practices.

  reading comprehension requirements.
- [typed-json-dataclasses](https://github.com/abatilo/typed-json-dataclass),
  zero configuration strong typing for data models and json SerDe your
